        <div style="margin: 10px; display: flex;">
            <canvas id="canvas" style="margin: auto;" data="palette.png">
            You need a browser recent enough to support the canvas element 
            and enable Javascript to use this page.</canvas>
        </div>
        <div id="description" style="display: inline-grid;"></div>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>When full color management is enabled, Firefox will modify the colors
           of images to have the appropriate appearance given what it knows
           about the color gamut of your monitor. This also includes images that
           are loaded into <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> elements.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, when Javascript then requests the browser tell it what
           pixels are in the canvas, it gives it back the modified pixels that
           are now color managed, not the original pixels that the Javascript 
           loaded in. If you have gone to the trouble of using a custom color
           profile that matches your monitor, the results are almost certainly
           unique to you and can be used to track you across sites and sessions,
           even in Private mode.</p>
        <h2>Which configurations are affected</h2>
        <p>Every configuration with full color management, i.e. a color profile 
        set (either automatically pulled from the system or set manually with
        <code>gfx.color_management.display_profile</code>) and full color 
        management turned on (<code>gfx.color_management.mode = 1</code>), is
        affected by this issue.</p>
        <h3>Important note:</h3>
        <p>In order to avoid false positives, I did not tag the test image with
        a profile. This is why full color management has to be enabled. A
        fingerprinter not worried about producing a lot of false positives could
        tag the test image with an sRGB profile, thereby triggering color
        management directly (as long as a monitor profile is set).</p>
        <p>The reason this triggers false positives is that some browsers 
        (possibly including Safari?) could be performing a conversion to
        sRGB in such a way that the resulting data on the canvas does get 
        modified, but not in way that varies from user to user.</p>
        <p>If you would like to try this proof of concept with these false
        positives permitted, <a href="falsepositives.html">click here</a>.</p>
        <h2>Note about macOS:</h3>
        <p>On macOS, Firefox converts all images to sRGB at the first stage in
        the pipeline. This means that the gamut of images is limited: you can't
        view wide gamut or HDR images in Firefox on macOS. Firefox does this in
        order to get color management for free on that platform, which works fine
        as long as you don't need to view wide gamut images. This is a new feature
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/89.0/releasenotes/">
            as of Firefox 89</a>.</p>
        <p>This has the side effect of breaking the demo. The data on the canvas
        is just the sRGB data (the same as the input file), so when it is
        retrieved later it has not been modified. In order to change this, you
        have to disable the new behavior and use traditional color management
        instead:<pre>gfx.color_management.native_srgb = false</pre></p>
