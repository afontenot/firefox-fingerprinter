        <div style="margin: 10px; display: flex;">
            <canvas id="canvas" style="margin: auto;">You need a browser recent 
            enough to support the canvas element and enable Javascript to use 
            this page.</canvas>
        </div>
        <div id="description" style="display: inline-grid;"></div>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>When full color management is enabled, Firefox will modify the colors
           of input images to have the appropriate appearance given what it knows
           about the color gamut of your monitor. This also includes images that
           are loaded into <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> elements.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, when Javascript then requests the browser tell it what
           pixels are in the canvas, it gives it back the modified pixels that
           are now color managed, not the original pixels that the Javascript 
           loaded in. If you have gone to the trouble of using a custom color
           profile that matches your monitor, the results are almost certainly
           unique to you and can be used to track you across sites and sessions,
           even in Private mode.</p>
